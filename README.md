**React12** is a challenge to build 12 simple web apps in 12 days using vanilla React with Vite. This idea originated from [JavaScript14](https://github.com/waterrmalann/Javascript14) and aims to be done in the same way.

Each of the app built during the course of the challenge are meant to be just functional, therefore they are not however guaranteed to be visually pleasing (although efforts have been made) or mobile responsive due to the limited time constraints.

| Day | App | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 01 | Expense Tracker | Simple expenses tracking. |
| 02 | Password Generator | Randomly generate strong passwords. |


### Give it a try!

I encourage you to try something similar! Challenges are a great way to learn as well as improve your abilities. You can use this repository as a reference and try to create 10-15 tiny but useful web apps in the same amount of days. For an added challenge, try coming up with new ideas or add new features to the existing web apps.
